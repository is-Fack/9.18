\b0 \
1. This End User License Agreement ("EULA") sets out the terms and conditions on which you are granted a License to use Charles, subject to your payment of any applicable License Fee.

\pard\tx1140\pardeftab720\li1134\fi-564\ri-340\sl276\slmult1\sb100\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf0 (a)	A User License, which permits Charles to be installed and used on a single computer at a time. A User License permits Charles to be installed and used on a second computer if the same person is using the two installations of Charles at one time. If you are using Charles as part of a free 30-day trial, then your use will be on the basis of a User License.\
(b)	A Site License, which permits Charles to be installed and used on every computer at a single Site operated by you.\
(c)	A Multi-Site License permits Charles to be installed and used on every computer at every Site operated by you. A Site License or Multi-Site License permits you to use Charles on a reasonable number of computers at premises other than the licensed Site, which you and your Site-based users may use from time to time (e.g., at client premises, or for at-home use).\

\cf0 2. A User License, Site License or Multi-Site License is valid for the current major version of Charles at the time of purchase (currently 4.X), and remains valid for all updates up to but not including the next major version (5.X). A User License, Site License or Multi-Site License is eligible for free upgrade to the next major version of Charles if the next major version is released within three months of the original License Fee. Upgrades to the next major version of Charles after that three month period will be subject to payment of an upgrade fee of 40% of the original License Fee. Other than as set out in this Clause 2, we have no obligation to provide updates or upgrades to Charles, or otherwise maintain or support Charles.\
